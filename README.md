Hello all, I am aria-robot, a secondary account of someone anonymous. I am a java game developer probably 2-4 months into developing and learning.
I learn in a different way by trying things first, then if they don't work I find what is wrong and repeat the process. I am looking for some colleagues to 
develop java games with me. I am a small creator and you may see my work up here on github. I would like to cooperate with people, hopefully within Australia
but I am open to online communication. Even though this is my secondary account, my main one has not had any uploads because this is for unofficial games 
and/or programs, the main one releases fully fledged games.
